# **Creating Multi Task Models With Keras**

**Author:** Dr. Ronny Guendel  
**Date:** [Insert Today's Date]

## **About The Project**

I used the Keras and TensorFlow libraries to build a deep neural network for creating a multi-task model. The model is designed to detect two features simultaneously from a photo: the number and the predominant color. We used the MNIST dataset for this project.

I used Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, but Google Colab can also be used.

## **Visual Representation**

**Here, the image contains some noise and a predominant color.**

## **Model Prediction**

**Here are some sample images predicted by the model.**
